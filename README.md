> Building an issue tracker application using Next JS. 

## Notable Tech and tools: 

1. Frontend and backend: (Next JS APP Router)[https://nextjs.org/docs)
2. ORM: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
3. Database: MySQL deployed on [Planet Scale](https://planetscale.com/)
4. Authentication: [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
5. Styles: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
